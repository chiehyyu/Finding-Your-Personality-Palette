## Introduction
The topic idea comes from our enthusiasm towards color science and psychological tests. We found out that the psychology tests nowadays restrict their participants to answer particular questions to get an customized output. However, since people's emotions and personality are quite complicated, we think it would be better to accept a wider range of inputs to analyze the results better. Also, we believe that dialogues may not contain only one type of emotions, it could be complicated combinations. Therefore, we chose to show our results via colors.
